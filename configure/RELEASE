# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file is parsed by both GNUmake and an EPICS Perl script,
# so it can ONLY contain definititions of paths to other support
# modules, variable definitions that are used in module paths,
# and include statements that pull in other RELEASE files.
# Variables may be used before their values have been set.
# Build variables that are NOT used in paths should be set in
# the CONFIG_SITE file.

# Variables and paths to dependent modules:
#SYNAPPS_MODULES = /usr/local/epics-nfs/modules/R3.14.12.8/synApps/R6.0/support/
#ASYN = $(SYNAPPS_MODULES)/asyn-R4-33
#BUSY = $(SYNAPPS_MODULES)/busy-R1-7
#CALC = $(SYNAPPS_MODULES)/calc-R3-7-1
#MOTOR = $(SYNAPPS_MODULES)/motor-R6-10-1
SYNAPPS_MODULES = /usr/local/epics-nfs/modules/R3.15.6/synApps/R6.1/support/
ASYN = $(SYNAPPS_MODULES)/asyn-R4-36
BUSY = $(SYNAPPS_MODULES)/busy-R1-7-2
CALC = $(SYNAPPS_MODULES)/calc-R3-7-3
MOTOR = $(SYNAPPS_MODULES)/motor-R7-1

#MSI = /usr/local/epics-nfs/extensions/R3.14.12.8/bin/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)/msi
PMAC = /usr/local/epics-nfs/modules/R3.15.6/pmac

# If using the sequencer, point SNCSEQ at its top directory:
#SNCSEQ = $(MODULES)/seq-ver

RECCASTER = /usr/local/epics-nfs/apps/recsync/1.4_epics_3.14/client

# EPICS_BASE should appear last so earlier modules can override stuff:
#EPICS_BASE = /usr/local/epics-nfs/base/R3.14.12.8
EPICS_BASE = /usr/local/epics-nfs/base/R3.15.6

# Set RULES here if you want to use build rules from somewhere
# other than EPICS_BASE:
#RULES = $(MODULES)/build-rules

# These allow developers to override the RELEASE variable settings
# without having to modify the configure/RELEASE file itself.
